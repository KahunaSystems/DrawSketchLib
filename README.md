Draw Sketch on scratchpad in swift3(Currenlty available for iPad only).  

1. Just instantiate the object of class <b>DrawSketchViewController</b> like:

      let drawsketchVC = DrawSketchViewController(nibName: "DrawSketchViewController", bundle: nil)

2. Set <b>previosAnnotationImagePath</b>, if you are editing existing sketch.

3. Set <b>isNewSnap</b> to true, in case of new Sketch.
